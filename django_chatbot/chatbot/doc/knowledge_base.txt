# What is Django?
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern.

# Key Features of Django
1. **Batteries-Included**: Comes with built-in tools like authentication, admin panel, and ORM.
2. **Security**: Protects against SQL injection, CSRF, and XSS attacks.
3. **Scalability**: Can handle high traffic websites.
4. **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)**: Simplifies database interactions.

# What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It first retrieves relevant documents from a database and then generates a response based on the retrieved knowledge.

# How does Django support AI development?
Django supports AI and ML projects through:
1. **REST APIs**: Integrates with AI models via Django Rest Framework.
2. **Background Tasks**: Uses Celery for async AI processing.
3. **Data Handling**: ORM makes it easy to interact with databases.

# What is FAISS?
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an open-source library for fast similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is used in RAG models for efficient retrieval of relevant documents.

# How to deploy a Django chatbot?
